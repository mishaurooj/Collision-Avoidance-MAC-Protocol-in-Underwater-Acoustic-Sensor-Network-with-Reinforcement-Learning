## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. `Time_MAC2.ipynb`
- Implements a **time-based MAC protocol** for underwater networks.  
- Uses RL for adaptive time-slot assignment and efficient collision avoidance.  

### 2. `Timescedul_CA_MAC_using_RL.ipynb`
- Focuses on **collision avoidance scheduling**.  
- Leverages RL agents to dynamically allocate time slots to nodes, reducing packet loss and improving throughput.  

### 3. `Timeslot_MAC_RL_ahmad.ipynb`
- Experimental notebook that refines **timeslot-based MAC scheduling** using reinforcement learning.  
- Compares results across multiple simulation runs.

## ðŸŒŠ Background
Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are used in ocean monitoring, surveillance, and environmental applications.  
However, they face challenges due to:
- High propagation delays  
- Low bandwidth availability  
- High probability of collisions in shared medium  

To address these, this work applies **Reinforcement Learning** to design an intelligent **MAC protocol** for efficient communication.
